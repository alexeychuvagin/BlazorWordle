# BlazorWordle
A simple implementation of the Wordle game in Blazor.

- The design and idea of the game are taken from the original game, which you can find [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
- The list of words are used in the game is taken from [Stanford University](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt).
- This implementation doesn't contain all features of the original one.
